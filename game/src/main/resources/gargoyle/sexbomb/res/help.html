You must locate all mines (or "bombs") in a mine field as quickly as
possible. You do this by uncovering squares that do not contain a mine
using your left mouse button, and marking squares that do with a flag,
using your right mouse button.
<p>When you uncover a square, you will either see a mine (and lose
    thegame), or the number of mines directly adjacent to (or "touching")
    thatsquare, ranging from 1 through 8. (If there are no mines touching
    the square, you automatically uncover all adjacent empty squares.)</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to reach a certain point
    score(depending on the skill level you have chosen, see below) as fast
    aspossible.</p>
